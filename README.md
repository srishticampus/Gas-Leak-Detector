# Gas-Leak-Detector
This project is a gas leak detection system using an MQ-3 gas sensor and an LCD screen. It checks the air for dangerous gas levels (like alcohol or LPG), and if it detects too much gas, it shows a “GAS_LEAK” warning on the screen. It also shows the current gas level as a number.
